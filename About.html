                In view of establishing Nursing colleges, management gathered information. As management came to know that any educational institution should be under any Registered Society/Trust/Company. This was known to management by the Person whom we can treat as a “Torchbearer” to our educational institutions. He was Mr. Late Venkateswara Sahu. We are up to here today because of Mr. Sahu’s invaluable, uncountable and speechless guidance. Amrutha Educational Society, Reg.No: 604/2017, was formed with nine members from same family. It was with blessings of late Mr. Srimannarayana, Retd. Asst. Engineer from Andhra Pradesh Government. He is a Chairman to our educational institutions. This society was registered on 14th September, 2017. Mr. V. Srimannarayana passed away on 6th March, 2018 after society got Government Permission (GO’s) to establish Nursing colleges under this society.     </p>
